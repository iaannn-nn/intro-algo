*The most valuable acquisitions in a scientific or technical education are the general-purpose mental tools which remain serviceable for a life-time. (George Forsythe, "What to do till the computer scientist comes" (1968))*





1. Organize algorithms by algorithm design techniques is a must and superior, compared to organized by problem types as the latter lose the coherence and add more confusion to student 
2. Algorithm design techniques is applicable to problems beyond computing.

**New taxonomy of algorithm design techniques is better**

1. Includes strategies: brute-force, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, space and time trade-offs, and iterative improvement
2. able to cover many classic algo such as Euclid's algo, heapsort, search trees, ..
3. natually suitable for presenting the varieties of several design techniques.For example, three variations of decreaseand-conquer and three variations of transform-and-conquer
4. better aligned with analytical methods for efficiency analysis

**Design techniques as general problem solving strategies**

These design techniques can be used as general problem solving strategies, not just limited to traditional computing and mathematical problems:
1. more computing applications go beyond the traditional domain
2. developing students' problem solving skills is a must and teaching algorithm design techniques is niche for that task

**Textbook Pedagogy( text book way of teaching)**
1. stress major ideas underlying design and analysis of algorithms
2. Chapter 2: devoted to efficiency analysis
3. Narrative often disrupts by questions so that readers not lose their focus.
4. End of Chapter is summary all the important points

**Prerequisites**
1. gone through an introductory programming
2. Standard course on discrete structures.

**Use in curriculum**
1. Read more the in the book
