*Two ideas like gleaming on the jeweler's velvet. The first is the calculus, the second, the algorithm. The calculus and the rich body of mathematical analysis to which it gave rise made modern science possible; but it has been the algorithm that has made possible the modern world. David Berlinski, The Advent of the Algorithm, 2000*

**Why do you need to study algorithm?**
0. Â Algorithm: a special kind of solutions to problems. not just answers but precisely defined procedures for getting answers
1. Algorithmics(The study of algorithms)is the cornerstone of computer science
2. Computer programs would not exist without algorithms
3. As computer applications becoming indispensable, studying algorithms becomes more necessary now.
4. Studying Algorithm is useful in developing analytical skills.
5. Donald Knuth put it as follows: *A person well-trained in computer scinece knows how to deal with algorithms: **how to construct them, manipulate them, understand them, analyze them**....An attempt to formalize things as algorithms leads to a much deeper understanding than if we simply try to comprehend things in the traditional way*
6. **Examine** "computing the greatest common divisor"- 3 algorithms differ in their idea, level of sophistication and efficiency => **several important properties of algorithm in general**
7. Learn abt algorithmic problem solving => **several important issues related to the design and analysis of algorithm** => (1) analyse problems, (2) means of express algo, (3) establish correctness, (4) analyze efficency => **to organize your work on design and analyze algorithms.**
8. **Study** a few very important problem type. => **most commonly encountered** but also to **demonstrate** particular **algorithm design techniques**
9. Cover review of **fundamental data structures** -> reference

**What is an algorithm?**
1. An algorithm: sequence of **unambigous** instructions to solve a problem, such that desired output for **any legitimate input** is obtained within a **finite amount of time.**
2. 5 points about algorithm
- each of its steps must be an **unambigous**
- **range of input** must be **specified** carefully
- **same algo** in **diff** **representation**
- **diff algos** for **the same problem**
- algos for same problem **based on diff ideas** and solved for **dramatically diff speeds.**

**Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem solving(Read more later)**
1. We can consider algorithms to be procedural solutions to problems
2. Algo is the procedure to get the answers, not the answers
3. emphasis on precisely defined constructive procedures make computer science distinct from other disciplines
4. Steps to go through in designing and analyzing an algorithm"
	1. Undestand the problem
	2. Ascetaining the capabilities of the computational device
	3. Choosing between exact and approximate problem solving
	4. Algorithm Design Techniques.
	5. Design an algorithm and data structures
